# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Establish Nemalo as an Apache-2.0 Go CLI/TUI application, with no Python prototype
  in the repository. Use `nemalo` as the command/integration identifier.
- Add shared read-only inventory with explicit roots, link skipping, bounds,
  optional SHA-256 hashes, and incomplete-result reporting.
- Add bounded Open Library discovery with stable IDs, paging, cancellation,
  rate control, checked redirects, and clear discovery-only availability.
- Add strict configuration/path precedence, capability reporting, and schema-versioned
  JSON results. CLI and TUI use the same application services and safe formatting.
- Pin Go and verification tools; add offline tests and a native three-OS CI workflow
  enforcing formatting, compilation, vet, Staticcheck, 80% coverage, race checks,
  vulnerability checks, and cgo-free executable smokes.

Downloads, format validation, scanners, extraction, checked publication, durable
library state, cleanup, audiobook management, and MCP are not implemented yet.
Generated analysis/workspaces and model/harness integrations remain post-1.0.
